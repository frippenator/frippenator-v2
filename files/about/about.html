    <p>My name is Fripp <font color="gray">(contrary to popular belief, this is not a nickname, nor is it short for anything. I'm not exactly sure what it would be short for, anyway)</font>. 
    I'm <span id="age"></span> and a high school dropout turned college student <font color="gray">(Studio Arts specifically)</font> who's crawling out of his 
    NEET cocoon. I found that being inside all day actually drove me insane. Below is a real picture of me:</p>
    <button onclick="togglePlay()"><img src ="https://file.garden/aJJNLka3yQqsHRr5/Websites/2%20neocities-frippenator-v2/Tenda" alt="A sprite of a Tenda, a species from the game MOTHER 2. It is a muted teal. Its eyes are little black dots, and its mouth is a straight black line. When clicked, a Duke Nukem voice line plays.">
    </button>

    <p>I need to practice writing about myself. I've discovered that any course that 
    I take which requires writing will almost always ask of you to write about 
    yourself and your opinions. I also get nervous about saying "I" too much; sometimes that thing about Hemmingway's editors needing to replace the ink for
    the letter "I" because he talked about himself so much comes to mind.</p>

    <p>I don't really have any strong opinions on things that do not fall into Maslow's
    Hierarchy of Needs. As in, I think equity and basic human rights is good... apparently this
    is much more polarizing than I anticipated.</p>
    <p>I am, however, passionate about the things I like, even if I sometimes shy away from talking about them.</p>
    <p>One thing I really, really, <i>really</i> like is Captain Falcon <font color="gray">(and <i>F-Zero</i> by proxy.)</font>. He is awesome and I want him in the foulest of ways. I also
    enjoy the <i>Space Odessey</i> series, <i>Judge Dredd, The Tick, Metal Gear Solid, Animal Crossing,</i> and <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</i>
    </p>
    <p>Regarding music, I used to say I "liked everything," however I soon learned to not lie. I am a remarkably picky
    motherfucker. My current favorite artists are Foetus, Coil, Primus, Chrome, This Heat, Space Streakings, and Darth Vegas. I have a soft spot for Nine Inch Nails; my first ever favorite song was <i>Terrible Lie</i> and I'd cry for my mom to play it when I was four.</p>
    <p>I'm also quite fond of my cats: Jaguar, Xena, and Misha. Jaguar is 12, while Xena and Misha are both
    around two years old as of writing this.</p>
        <p>I used to be somewhat into MBTI, however I gave up on understanding it. To me, it's secular astrology: fun, but nothing to take too seriously. However, for grins, I think I'm probably an ISTP.</p>
    <p>I dabble in whatever interests me, whether it be fiddling with legacy technology, learning a new art medium,
        or pinning bugs. Because I'm apparently a masochist, I'm pursing a visual arts career. There's a 
    PBS show I like called <i>Canvasing the World</i>, in which the host travels to various destinations and ends with a painting
inspired by what he saw. He said something along the lines of wanting to make art no matter what. He went backpacking in Europe with only
a handful of euros and paid his way in paintings, and that's what inspired the show. That really struck me, so, idealistically, I want to do something like that. Without the TV show
involved.</p>
<p>When I'm not being productive, I stare at the ceiling and wonder why poop is brown. I know <i>why</i> poop is brown but it still weirds me out...</p>
