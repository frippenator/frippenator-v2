Jesus fuck, that took forever. My IDE randomly stopped syncing correctly and I had to push it to GitHub several times before hard resetting Codium for the widget to work. Actual hell on earth. &quot;Share and enjoy,&quot; Ã  la the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation.

<title>New blog entry + rearranged some things</title>
<link>blog/2025_08_21.html</link>
<description>
I remembered that I can just make seperate HTML files for each entry rather than make one gigantic blog file. I think I&apos;ll just stick to that. Expect a guestbook or some sort of comment widget soon, and perhaps an archive of my first layout whenever I figure out how I want to showcase it.

Now to figure out how to add tags and make it not clunky... If anyone knows how to make static blogging pages a bit more convenient, do share. I might just bite the bullet and just post stuff on an external site, but where&apos;s the fun in that?

Wow! It&apos;s so empty and generic! I decided to give my site a huge overhaul after a year of not updating it. It was far too daunting when it was all fancy-like... It&apos;ll start having more character eventually, but I needed a blank slate. Mind the mess.

<title>RSS feed now up</title>

<description>
Finally added an RSS feed to this site, rather than an ever-expanding wall of text for updates. Was rather clunky. This is a test... cheers to making websites and whatnot.
