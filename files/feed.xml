Wow! It&apos;s so empty and generic! I decided to give my site a huge overhaul after a year of not updating it. It was far too daunting when it was all fancy-like... It&apos;ll start having more character eventually, but I needed a blank slate. Mind the mess.

Finally added an RSS feed to this site, rather than an ever-expanding wall of text for updates. Was rather clunky. This is a test... cheers to making websites and whatnot.
