                <h4>2025, August 28th</h4>
                <p>School has started up for me again. I'm taking four classes this time around. Last fall semester I overestimated my ability
                to juggle work after not being in school for over two years, but I think I have a proper grip on it now. Prior to the latter half of last
                semester, I wasn't quite sure what degree I wanted to pursue. The arts seemed like the ill-advised choice, so I was initially thinking about
                some sort of environmental science path. I ended up just going with the thing I like doing the most... I scored free tuition for a few years, anyway.
                It's best to do what I want with my time.</p>
                <p>I'm taking two art classes (Drawing I and Two-Dimensional Design) along with a creative writing course and... Contemporary Math. It's such a funny
                name to me. It's basically just statistics, finances, conversions... Things you use. No algebra. I like this sort of math and, thankfully, it's the last
                math class I'll have to take with my degree plan.
                </p>
                <p>On a dumb note, I blew my voice out by singing/screaming in my car while driving to school yesterday morning. I will do it again this afternoon; my Tuesday/Thursday classes start
                and end really late... I get out well into the heart of evening rush hour which I'm not excited about.
                </p>
                <p>I'm already quite enjoying the drawing course. I've been wanting to try charcoal for a while and this gives me a proper excuse. It's very low-key, too. I'll start posting some of my work on here soon, along
                with any fiction I write for class that I end up liking...</p>
                <p>Speaking of site things, I'm planning on making a more in-depth writeup about an event I went to this past weekend. Historically, my city's Pride events have always been held in
                August, and since this year's theme was "Silence = Death," the AIDS quilt was in town for the first time this century.
                It was definitely a moving and emotionally taxing experience, so I want to give myself more time to really process it and give it the undivided attention it deserves.
                But, I will say that it's important now more than ever to <i>remember our queer history</i>.
