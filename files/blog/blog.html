                <h4>2025, August 20th</h4>
                <p>Been feeling kinda bleh lately. I'm assuming it's because I haven't had much
                to do outside of vegetating and whatnot. Summer seasonal depression is a beast; I'm so bored
                that I was thinking about trying Grindr out again for the hell of it. Thankfully, I have a modicum
                of self respect, so I did not do that.</p>
                <p>I'm excited for classes to resume, though
                I'm certainly going to miss the amount of free time I've had over the past three months.</p>
                <p>Aside from that, I've been excided about being able to do web stuff again. Ever since, say,
                a few months after launching my first layout, I was itching to do something with it, but my
                spaghetti code intimidated me. I am but a dog that gets scared of its own farts.</p>
                <p>I'm thinking that I'll use this as both a journal and a portfolio for creative works. I haven't used
                traditional social media in years (excluding the bi-annual question on Reddit) so I've sorta forgot how to
                put myself out there on the internet. Of course, with classes on the horizon, updating
                might be few and far between. Alas, we'll see what happens. </p>
