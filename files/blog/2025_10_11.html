        <p>It's been a while!</p>
        <p>I have a lot to share... so let's go chronologically.</p>

            Make Everyone's Day Worse</i

        </h5>
        <p>
          About eight days after my last update -- I had a blog post ready for
          the 10th of September, actually -- I did something remarkably stupid.
          I was trying to format a USB stick so I could put a live image of a
          Linux environment specifically made for writing on it. I wasn't sure
          what the name of the USB was, though I was under the assumption that
          my computer's harddrive was named "sda," or something along those
          lines. So, I mounted a disk called "nmve0n1."
        </p>
        <p>This was a very stupid mistake.</p>
        <p>
          Unaware of this fatal blunder, I proceeded to use my computer as
          normal for about a day. Then, my computer died a few minutes before my
          second period. Thinking all was normal, I warned the person sitting in
          front of me that my computer may make a loud beep when it comes back
          on (I have a dead CMOS battery. The replacement is coming today,
          actually). It did not beep. It was stuck in a boot loop
        </p>
        <p>
          Tinkering with my computer during the lecture, I wasn't sure exactly
          what was going on. I hit F12 a few times to try to boot into Mint, to
          no avail. It simply looped once more. Then, after messing around in
          the GRUB cli for about ten minutes, things slowly started clicking: I
          formatted my fucking computer!
        </p>
        <p>
          All was not lost, though. In fact, I sorta wanted a blank slate,
          anyway. I got this computer (a ThinkPad L14) last August, and this was
          only a few months after I started really getting into Linux. So, there
          was a lot of junk that I didn't feel like organizing and packages I
          didn't want to mess with. After a few days, I was able to properly
          install and configure Void Linux. To me, it's a happy in-between of
          the two distros I've daily driven: Gentoo and Mint. I don't plan on
          switching any time soon.
        </p>
        <h5><a href="https://youtu.be/0sajngb0W6I">N-n-n-n-nineteen</a></h5>
        <p>
          I turned 19 on the 28th of September. It seems like a very awkward
          in-between age, though this is the last year that I'm a teenager... I
          suppose that's a milestone it itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a pretty fine birthday. I always get the birthday blues, so I
          was a bit mopey at the beginning. I got some cool stuff, though, and
          got to hang out with my dad and friends. I found a copy of the SNES
          <i>F-Zero</i> at Half Price Books for twenty bucks, along with a
          <i>Judge Dredd</i> comic and an unabridged audio book CD of
          <i>2001: A Space Odyssey...</i> My car had an issue with intermittent
          stalling, which we later found out was an issue with the idle air
          control valve, so I borrowed my dad's truck again. Lord is that thing
          annoying to drive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had hotpot with my friends and discovered that, though I love eating
          octopi sushi, eating a whole baby octopus is the worst sensory
          experience of all time. The brains explode in your mouth. I would not
          recommend. Then I gorged on ube ice cream.
        </p>
        <h5>"My God, it's full of stars!"</h5>
        <p>Ahem.</p>
        <p>
          So, during my car's weeklong probation, I was driven to and from
          school by my dad, primarily. My mom drove me up there a handful of
          times, but she left for a trip on the 1st.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dad's main vehicle was also kaput. Or, well, it still is. We're
          getting it back on Monday, but whatever. Thus, we were in the old
          truck. It's been running significantly better with how much it's been
          used...
        </p>
        <p>
          Point being, the radio in it doesn't work. Not even static comes
          through. The audiobook I bought came in clutch!
        </p>
        <p>
          We finished it in a few days. There was a point where we were at the
          last chapter or so when we got back home, and we took the discs inside
          and blasted them on my CD player in my room since we didn't want to
          stop. A day after, on the third, I watched the movie.
        </p>
        <p>Holy fuck.</p>
        <p>
          I haven't had that sensation where you instictually know a piece of
          media is going to stick with you in a while. Needless to say, I'm neck
          deep in the Space Odyssey series now. I bought a copy of
          <i>2010: Odyssey Two</i> on the 6th and I'm already halfway through. I
          am HAL 9000's #2 defender behind Dr. Chandra.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm going to buy a physical copy of the first book once I've read the
          whole series... or at least when I see it available. I don't think I
          got the full experience of it in audio form, just because there were a
          handful of times I got distracted when we were listening to it (i.e.,
          noisy passengers) so I'll probably reread it... again and again...
        </p>
        <h5>A gigabite of RAM should do the trick...</h5>
        <p>
          I didn't know what dumb title I should give this section. It has
          nothing to do with RAM. Unless you were very technical about it...
        </p>
        <p>
          A few days ago, I decided on a whim to turn my old ThinkPad T440p into
          a music server. I thought this would be much easier than it ended up
          being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Installing Ubuntu LTE was the easiest part, of course. The issue was
          the "getting it to work outside of my house" part. I first tinkered
          with Plex before switching to
          <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> due to issues with Plex
          not wanting to work properly on my dinky phone. Plus, FOSS stuff just
          feels nicer to use. None of this would've even happened if I wasn't a
          moral stickler about the services I use... I still dread having to use
          Google services, but there's little I can do to avoid that.
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, I first attempted to execute this with port forwarding.</p>
        <p>
          Do not do this. I fucked up everything by doing this and it gave me a
          damn migraine. If you do not know what you are doing, nor if you're
          not sure of how to configure port forwarding on your router, do not
          bother. I managed to somehow screw up along the way and made SSH-ing
          into my server impossible.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, I redid it.</p>
        <p>
          In the first attempt, I named the poor computer "porncuter9000"
          because for whatever reason, my dad named the lone Windows machine I
          have "porncuter." Riveting humor runs in the family.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second attempt, I affectionately re-christened it "hal9000"
          because not only am I super original, I'm also on the spectrum. Golly!
        </p>
        <p>
          Things went a lot smoother. I said to hell with port forwarding and
          used <a href="https://netbird.io/">Netbird</a> instead. It's a P2P...
          thing. I can't describe it. It's kinda like a VPN but not. I recommend
          it if you want to try doing something similar, along with taking a
          look at <a href="https://youtu.be/lXcfKTNObOo">these</a>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5Y3a7pvpn8">two</a> videos by TechHut as a
          guide. It took a while to configure, but now it works, and that's what
          matters.
        </p>
        <h5>And another thing...</h5>
        <p>
          Um. I will put up the art section... soon. I just need to photograph
          my stuff properly. I'm also planning on making a reading log section
          to keep track of the books I've read.
        </p>
        <p>
          I probably won't do a blog every single update like I've been doing in
          the future. It'll probably be more like... semimonthly or so from here
          on out. Also, I completed my first creative writing project for one of
          my classes a while ago, so I might post that here if I pretty it up
          and make it flow to my liking. I cranked most of it out an hour before
          the deadline, in my typical fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          To whoever reads these: thank you! It means a lot, truly. I know my
          site isn't the most visually interesting, but it's definitely my baby
          and I pour a lot of love into it. I hope you enjoy my rambling... This
          is essentially my journal, for I don't write in my physical one as
          much as I should.
        </p>
