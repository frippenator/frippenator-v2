        <h4>A Peculiar Feud Regarding HAL 9000's Sexuality on Wikipedia</h4>
        <p>
          Wikipedia is a very amazing place. The fact that we have an online
          encyclopedia encompassing such a vast array of knowledge is wonderful,
          isn't it?
        </p>
        <p>
          As of writing -- the 17th of November, 2025 -- I've made a whopping
          four edits, all of which were correcting syntax and adding links to
          very, very niche articles. I was going to go to a Wikimedia event on
          the 2nd, however, schedule conflicts arose. One day, I'll properly
          contribute to the site. Just not today. It's oddly intimidating to me...
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the broader scope of Wikipedia is not the focus of this
          article.
        </p>
        <p>
          I, along with loads of other people, have had an inkling in regards to
          HAL 9000's sexuality. To my knowledge, this dates back to some initial
          reactions to the original Kubrick film. HAL sounded quite queer to
          some audience members, which is not terribly surprising, since one of
          Douglas Rain's instructions when it came to HAL's voice was to sound a
          bit more "dandy."
        </p>
        <p>
          I, for one, think he was not queer enough. I think the film would've
          benefited greatly from a twenty minute scene of HAL making Dave wack
          off. Unfortunately, my creative geniusness was not consulted during
          its production.
        </p>
        <p>Ahem.</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to share with the world a humorous series of events that I
          discovered in the edit history of HAL 9000's Wikipedia article.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we start with the initial creation of the
          <i>Sexuality</i> subsection.
        </p>
        <img class="img" src="../images/scrsht/01.png" />
        <p>The text reads as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>Cultural critic Mark Dery, in his 2012 book</i> I Must Not Think Bad
          Thoughts: Drive-by Essays on American Dread, American Dreams<i>, argues
          that "HAL's sibilant tone and use of feline phrases like 'quite
          honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that' contains more than a
          hint of the stereotypic bitchy homosexual."[36] Dery makes reference
          to Alan Turing, a gay computer science known as the father of
          artificial intelligence and creator of the Turing test; he writes that
          "HAL was presumably raised by men and, like Turing, schooled in an
          all-male environment. That all-male environments are hotbeds of
          sublimated sexuality, haunted by the threat of same-sex love, is news
          to no one; English boarding schools such as Turing's, where 'contact
          between the boys was fraught with sexual potential' (Hodges), have
          long been the, er, butt of locker-room one-liners."[37]
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          In 1997, when asked about HAL's sexual orientation by cultural critic
          Paula Treichler at the University of Illinois' Cyberfest, Clarke said,
          "I don't know; I never asked him. His voice has a certain ambiguity,
          however."[37] When Dery posed the question to Clarke that same year by
          email, Clarke replied, "I can't confirm or deny your speculations. Who
          knows what goes on down in the subconscious?"[37]
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          In the 1987 edition of his book</i> The Celluloid Closet<i>, gay film
          historian Vito Russo includes</i> 2001: A Space Odyssey <i>in a list of films
          containing gay characters or references, citing the scene in which HAL
          wishes Frank a happy birthday.[38]</i>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HAL_9000&oldid=1159866411#Sexuality">link</a> to the initial edit.</p>
        <p>Another edit follows a little over a month later:</p>
        <img class="img" src="../images/scrsht/02.png">
        <p>The first paragraph is removed. Woe!</p>
        <p>Do I see how saying "stereotypic bitchy homosexual" could be considered uncouth? Yes. Do I think Dery's argument is homophobic? No. The book the quote is cited from,
          from what I can gather, tackles themes of masculinity and queerness in pop culture, among other things. Is it not noteworthy? No. I do not get why this was neutered, and it looks
          like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:HAL_9000#Sexuality_Section_Seems_Needlessly_Watered_Down?">I'm not alone in this assessment</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Then, about three weeks later, a bombshell!</p>
        <img class="img" src="../images/scrsht/03.png">
        <p>The entire section has been removed!</p>
        <p>Dear editor, I am delighted to inform you that HAL is, in fact, fictional, and is from a series that involves one of the main characters
          turning into an incorporeal plasma baby. Thus, HAL is not limited to the confines of reality. HAL can think carnally about the two infuriatingly attractive men onboard <i>Discovery</i> as much
          as he desires, thank you very much.
        </p>
        <p>A little while later:</p>
        <img class="img" src="../images/scrsht/04.png">
        <p>The neutered sexuality section is back! Unfortunately, not for long:</p>
        <img class="img" src="../images/scrsht/05.png">
        <p>People really don't like gay computers. Quite unfortunate.</p>
        <p>As of now, the Wikipedia article on HAL 9000 is currently devoid of a <i>Sexuality</i> section. I would restore it if I was not irrationally afraid of editing Wikipedia articles.</p>
        <p>... I hope you benefit greatly from this information.</p>
