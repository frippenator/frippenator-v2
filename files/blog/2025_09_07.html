                <h4>2025, September 07</h4>
                <p>I've gotten through… two weeks of school? Yeah. Things have been going pretty smoothly so far. Been able to stay on top of things. 
                    Not having a smartphone definitely makes it easier to stay concentrated during lulls between classes. I got a zero on my first math 
                    homework because I submitted it wrong, apparently, though now I somehow have a 126% in that class after the 
                    second week's homework and the quiz… interesting.</p>
                <p>There's a guy in my design class who's cute, but I have no idea how to flirt without seeming weird. Nor do I know whether or not he likes guys. Or if he has a partner already. Woe.</p>
                <p>My car overheated last Wednesday when I was heading back from class. The traffic was horrible and my car hates idling in the heat for too long. Luckily, I got it home before it went kaput, but it's still in the shop as of now, so I've been kinda gridlocked. Been using my dad's old truck when needed, but I'm not a fan of tall vehicles. Hard for me to tell where I am on the road… Thus, I've been vegetating this weekend. Been working on and off on a design project due Tuesday and started watching the 1998 Trigun today. I enjoy things with appallingly stupid amounts of guns. Perhaps it's in my Southern DNA.</p>
                <p>I'm turning nineteen three weeks from today! Last year as a teenager, I guess. Kinda weird. I don't know what else is exciting about that particular age.</p>
                <p>Site wise, I plan on adding an art page in the near future, starting off with some of my academic stuff. Once I'm more comfortable with my personal artwork, I'll share that, too. I just know that my academic stuff is going to, y'know, be finished… I also have to figure out how I want to display images, I'll figure out how to implement a lightbox so it isn't too unwieldy.</p>
