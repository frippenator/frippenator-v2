        <h4>2025, September 07</h4>
        <p>
          I've gotten through… two weeks of school? Yeah. Things have been going
          pretty smoothly so far. Been able to stay on top of things. Not having
          a smartphone definitely makes it easier to stay concentrated during
          lulls between classes. I got a zero on my first math homework because
          I submitted it wrong, apparently, though now I somehow have a 126% in
          that class after the second week's homework and the quiz… interesting.

          There's a guy in my design class who's cute, but I have no idea how to
          flirt without seeming weird. Nor do I know whether or not he likes
          guys. Or if he has a partner already. Woe.

          My car overheated last Wednesday when I was heading back from class.
          The traffic was horrible and my car hates idling in the heat for too
          long. Luckily, I got it home before it went kaput, but it's still in
          the shop as of now, so I've been kinda gridlocked. Been using my dad's
          old truck when needed, but I'm not a fan of tall vehicles. Hard for me
          to tell where I am on the road… Thus, I've been vegetating this
          weekend. Been working on and off on a design project due Tuesday and
          started watching the 1998 Trigun today. I enjoy things with
          appallingly stupid amounts of guns. Perhaps it's in my Southern DNA.

          I'm turning nineteen three weeks from today! Last year as a teenager,
          I guess. Kinda weird. I don't know what else is exciting about that
          particular age.

          Site wise, I plan on adding an art page in the near future, starting
          off with some of my academic stuff. Once I'm more comfortable with my
          personal artwork, I'll share that, too. I just know that my academic
          stuff is going to, y'know, be finished… I also have to figure out how
          I want to display images, I'll figure out how to implement a lightbox
          so it isn't too unwieldy.
